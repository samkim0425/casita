# Casita

[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-casita-0b6e4f?style=for-the-badge)](https://matin.github.io/casita/)

Casita is a personal rental-search tool published as a public repo.

It started as a small script for a time-boxed San Francisco rental search with
two large dogs: scrape Zillow, Craigslist, Zumper, and Redfin; enrich the
listings; rank them; and render a static page that was easier to review than
four open browser tabs.

This is not a product or service. It is published as-is, under MIT, as a
personal-use codebase for an interview loop. The interesting part is what a
candidate chooses to improve.

## Demo

The demo is credentials-free and uses a sanitized SQLite fixture with cached
route times and precomputed LLM enrichment.

```bash
uv sync
uv run playwright install chromium
uv run casita demo
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:8765/>.

### CasitaMash (this fork)

Pairwise preference learning on top of the fixture — FaceMash-style comparisons
that fit a hybrid model (`score = w·x + u`) so exchange rates generalize to
listings you never compared.

```bash
uv run casita mash
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8766/mash/>. Comparisons persist in gitignored
`tmp/mash.sqlite` (never the committed fixture). Flow: name → rank features →
compare → end session for a ranked list with Casita + source links.

**Why this:** Casita’s learning signal was 16 upvotes in a capped few-shot block.
Ranking ~118 listings by comparison alone needs on the order of n log n picks;
learning ~15 feature weights needs dozens, then every listing gets a score.
Rejected: shortlist-stability as a *selection* objective, priors from the
onboarding ranking, hand-curated grocery anchors, editing the browse view or
ranking prompt. Kept: soft “end session” when the top 20 holds still, sparse
labeled hypothetics, OSM-derived POIs, reviewer-isolated fits.

See `RECON.md` for fixture facts that shaped the design.

The demo does not scrape, call Vertex, deploy to Firebase, read GCS, or call the
Google Maps Routes API. It does use Playwright's local Chromium browser to
render Open Graph preview images from listing photos and facts. Live `search` /
`enrich` / `publish` paths still exist for private use and are controlled by
environment variables; see `.env.example`.

## What It Does

- Scrapes active rental listings from Zillow, Craigslist, Zumper, and Redfin.
- Normalizes listing facts into SQLite.
- Classifies dog policy and enriches details from listing pages.
- Uses Gemini for fact extraction, photo review, share blurbs, and ranking.
- Computes walking and driving times to curated SF / Marin anchors.
- Renders a static, mobile-friendly site with index and detail pages.
- Records votes and passes so future ranking can learn from reviewer feedback.

The domain assumptions are intentionally personal: large dogs, San Francisco
walkability, Marin driving context, trails, beaches, and good bakeries nearby.
That is the point of a personal tool.

## Docs

The [documentation site](https://matin.github.io/casita/) explains the systems
without turning them into assigned tasks. To run it locally instead:

```bash
uv run zensical serve
```

Start at `docs/index.md`, or run `uv run zensical build` to generate the site.

## Checks

```bash
make check
```

This compiles the Python modules, runs the pytest suite, runs the public leak
validator, builds the docs, builds the Python package artifacts, and checks
that the CLI imports.

## Contributing

Read `CONTRIBUTING.md`. The short version: fork the repo, pick something you
think makes Casita better, and explain why you chose it.
